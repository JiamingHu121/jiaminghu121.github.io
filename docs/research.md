## Phonon-mediated nonlinear optics and quantum geometry

_Jiaming Hu, Wenbin Li†, and Hua Wang†_

**Introduction**

Nonlinear optics investigates the interactions between light and matter under high-intensity light conditions, offering promising applications in fields such as ultrafast optics, bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), nonlinear optical (NLO) sensing and imaging, optical transistors, and quantum computing. However, traditional NLO studies mainly focus on pure-electronic responses within the static crystal lattice, without considering the electron-phonon interactions, which leads to two major limitations: (1) The predominant attention has been paid on the frequency spectrum beyond the electronic band gap due to resonant NLO responses, excluding low-frequency nonlinear optical (NLO) responses; (2) The association of NLO responses with pure-electronic quantum geometry, while the link between phonon-mediated NLO (Ph-NLO) responses and the intrinsic quantum geometry of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) has not been established. Motivated by these insights, we present a series of works on comprehensive study of generalized Ph-NLO responses and EPC quantum geometry.

**Progress**

We firstly propose a [General framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09677) of Ph-NLO responses by Feynman diagram in a hierarchical structure. Based on that, ab initio codes of calculating Ph-NLO responses and EPC quantum geometric quantities are under developing, and will be finally open sources. A further study of coherent phonon and EPC topology is under exploration. A subsequent work on revealing the EPC quantum geometry in inducing ferroelectric phase transition is also ongoing.
